About This Manual
-----------------

This manual is designed to show you how to use AMEEconnect to embed
environmental intelligence from the AMEE platform into your applications
or systems.

Before You Start
----------------

As AMEEconnect is an HTTP-based service, we assume that you are familiar
with the operation of HTTP requests, as well as common formats like XML
and JSON. In some cases we use XPath and JSONPath as well.

API Versions
------------

This manual covers API version 2 of AMEEconnect only. If you need
documentation for API version 1, please refer to the legacy
documentation at
[http://www.amee.com/developer/docs/legacy](http://www.amee.com/developer/docs/legacy).
