So you want to use AMEEconnect? This part of the manual will get you
going, no problems. As it's a quick overview, we've left out the
detailed responses, just giving XPath[[4](bi01.md#xpath "[xpath]")]
details for the important bits. Subsequent chapters will go into much
more detail.

What is AMEEconnect?
--------------------

AMEEconnect is a web-based API that gives you access to the data and
capabilities of the AMEE platform. It allows you to store and retrieve
many forms of consumption data over long periods, while simultaneously
applying recognised carbon calculation models to determine the
environmental consequences of that consumption.

Getting Started
---------------

The first step in using AMEEconnect is to sign up for an API key. You
can get a free trial account at
[http://my.amee.com/signup](http://my.amee.com/signup). Enter your
details, and you will be emailed your new API key details.

This API key will give you access to the AMEE staging platform
(stage.amee.com). This platform is designed for you to use while you are
developing and testing your application. However, the data on it is
regularly wiped, so once you decide your application is ready to go into
production, you will need to change over to using the AMEE live platform
(live.amee.com; service fees may apply).

Throughout the following documentation, the examples will use the AMEE
stage platform URL.

Authentication
--------------

Once you've got your key, you're ready to start talking to the API
itself, and the first step is authentication.

AMEE uses *HTTP Basic* authentication. You simply provide your username
and password with every request, using the standard HTTP basic auth
format. Most HTTP libraries will support this functionality; some
examples are below:

-   [curl](javascript:;)
-   [Ruby](javascript:;)
-   [HTTP](javascript:;)

.

~~~~ {.programlisting}
curl https://stage.amee.com \
-u username:password
          
~~~~

.

.

~~~~ {.programlisting}
http = Net::HTTP.new @host, 443
http.use_ssl = true
req = Net::HTTP::Get.new @location
req.basic_auth @username, @password
http.request(req)
        
~~~~

.

.

#### Request

~~~~ {.programlisting}
GET / HTTP/1.1
Authorization: Basic dXNlcm5hbWU6cGFzc3dvcmQ=
          
~~~~

.

You should only use HTTP Basic authentication if you are connecting to
AMEEconnect over a secure HTTPS connection. Using HTTPS is highly
recommended, and all examples in this manual use it, but if you need to
use HTTP, see [the section called “Authenticated
Sessions”](ch06.md#authenticated-sessions "Authenticated Sessions") for
how to do secure authentication over insecure connections.

Content Types
-------------

AMEEconnect supports two content types. Depending on which format you
prefer to parse, you can choose either one. The information is the same
in both.

  Encoding   MIME type
  ---------- ------------------
  XML        application/xml
  JSON       application/json

You should specify your desired content type in the *Accept* header in
your HTTP request. For example:

-   [curl](javascript:;)
-   [XML](javascript:;)
-   [JSON](javascript:;)

.

~~~~ {.programlisting}
curl https://stage.amee.com/profiles \
-H 'Accept: application/xml' \
-u username:password
        
~~~~

.

.

#### Request

~~~~ {.programlisting}
GET /profiles HTTP/1.1
Accept: application/xml
Authorization: Basic dXNlcm5hbWU6cGFzc3dvcmQ=
          
~~~~

.

.

#### Request

~~~~ {.programlisting}
GET /profiles HTTP/1.1
Accept: application/json
Authorization: Basic dXNlcm5hbWU6cGFzc3dvcmQ=
          
~~~~

.

Create a Profile
----------------

To do calculations with AMEEconnect, you will need to create a
*Profile*. We'll get into more detail about profiles in [the section
called “Using AMEE to store
data”](ch05.md#store-data "Using AMEE to store data"), but for now
we'll just go ahead and create one.

To do this, you need to POST to the /profiles path, with 'profile=true'
in the body, like this:

-   [curl](javascript:;)
-   [XML](javascript:;)
-   [JSON](javascript:;)

.

~~~~ {.programlisting}
curl https://stage.amee.com/profiles \
-X POST -d 'profile=true' \
-H 'Accept: application/xml' \
-u username:password
        
~~~~

.

.

#### Request

~~~~ {.programlisting}
POST /profiles HTTP/1.1
Accept: application/xml
Content-Type: application/x-www-form-urlencoded
Authorization: Basic dXNlcm5hbWU6cGFzc3dvcmQ=
          
~~~~

~~~~ {.programlisting}
profile=true
          
~~~~

* * * * *

#### Response

~~~~ {.programlisting}
HTTP/1.1 200 OK
Content-Type: application/xml; charset=UTF-8
          
~~~~

.

.

#### Request

~~~~ {.programlisting}
POST /profiles HTTP/1.1
Accept: application/json
Content-Type: application/x-www-form-urlencoded
Authorization: Basic dXNlcm5hbWU6cGFzc3dvcmQ=
          
~~~~

~~~~ {.programlisting}
profile=true
          
~~~~

* * * * *

#### Response

~~~~ {.programlisting}
HTTP/1.1 200 OK
Content-Type: application/json; charset=UTF-8
          
~~~~

.

The returned XML or JSON contains a Profile object, which in turn has
what's known in AMEEconnect as a UID. This is a unique string that
identifies the profile (all entities in AMEEconnect actually have a UID,
as you'll see later). If you're using XML, the XPath you want to get the
UID from the response is *//Profile/@uid* which in this case gives us
YLLIKH73BDYS.

Choose a Data Item
------------------

The next step is to choose which calculation you actually want to do.
[AMEEdiscover](http://discover.amee.com) lists all the possible
calculations available in AMEE (over 8 million!), with rich searching
and tagging functionality to make it easy to find what you want. By
browsing the categories in AMEEdiscover, you can find the type of
calculation you want to do, and then by looking at the Data Items tab,
you can see the range of particular calculations that are possible in
that category. Each category has a path, and each data item is
identified by a set of drilldown choices. We need the UID of the data
item we want to use, and we get this by doing a drilldown request. This
request uses the path of the category and the drilldown choices you
choose, which in this case specify that we are interested in petrol.

-   [curl](javascript:;)
-   [XML](javascript:;)
-   [JSON](javascript:;)

~~~~ {.programlisting}
curl https://stage.amee.com/data/transport/defra/fuel/drill?fuel=petrol \
-H 'Accept: application/xml' \
-u username:password

.

.

#### Request

~~~~ {.programlisting}
GET /data/transport/defra/fuel/drill?fuel=petrol HTTP/1.1
Accept: application/xml
Authorization: Basic dXNlcm5hbWU6cGFzc3dvcmQ=
          
~~~~

* * * * *

#### Response

~~~~ {.programlisting}
HTTP/1.1 200 OK
Content-Type: application/xml; charset=UTF-8
          
~~~~

.

.

#### Request

~~~~ {.programlisting}
GET /data/transport/defra/fuel/drill?fuel=petrol HTTP/1.1
Accept: application/json
Authorization: Basic dXNlcm5hbWU6cGFzc3dvcmQ=
          
~~~~

#### Response

~~~~ {.programlisting}
HTTP/1.1 200 OK
Content-Type: application/json; charset=UTF-8
          
~~~~

.

The response contains a Choice node which contains the UID of the data
item, in this case AA6B1557CEA6. We will need this to identify the exact
calculation in the next step. As long as the drilldown is fully
qualified (we'll explain this later), you can extract it using the XPath
*//Choices/Choice/Name/text()*.

Do a Calculation
----------------

The last step is to actually perform the calculation. For this, you need
to use the information obtained from the above calls and put it all
together. We do a POST to the data category path *within* the profile
you created, and we specify the data item UID you got from the
drilldown. This tells the platform exactly which calculation you want to
perform. You also need to pass in some parameters for your calculation -
these are also listed in AMEEdiscover, in the Value Definitions tab.
Here, we will calculate the emissions of burning 500 litres of petrol:

-   [curl](javascript:;)
-   [XML](javascript:;)
-   [JSON](javascript:;)

~~~~ {.programlisting}

~~~~

* * * * *

#### Response

~~~~ {.programlisting}
HTTP/1.1 201 CREATED
Content-Type: application/json; charset=UTF-8
          
~~~~

.

The response contains a set of Amount nodes, which correspond to the
various results of the calculation (there can be more than one
sometimes). The results are in Amount nodes, so if we use the XPath
*//Amounts/Amount/text()*, we can see that under this methodology,
burning 500 litres of petrol produces around 1156kg of CO2-equivalent
emissions. Job done!

This is, of course, only a quick overview. The following chapters will
go into much more details on what it all means and what you can do with
it, and the reference sections contain full descriptions of the XML and
JSON responses which we've left out here.
