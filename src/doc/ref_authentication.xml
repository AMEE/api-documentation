	<title>Authentication</title>
  <para>
    &api_name; uses HTTP Basic authentication <biblioref linkend='httpbasic'/> for all 
    requests. The following example shows how this is done with the CURL command line 
    HTTP client.
  </para>
  <programlisting>curl https://live.amee.com/data -H "accept:application/xml" -u username:password</programlisting>
  <para>
    HTTP Basic authentication is sent as an Authorization header in each HTTP request. The header should contain
    a base64-encoded string in the form username:password, as shown in the example below.
  </para>
  <para>
    Because HTTP Basic sends your login credentials with every request encoded in base64 format,
    you should ensure you always use HTTPS connections to AMEE.
