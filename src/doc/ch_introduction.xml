    <para>
      This manual is designed to show you how to use &api_name; to embed environmental intelligence
      from the AMEE platform into your applications or systems. This allows you to perform carbon
	  or other sustainability-related calculations without having to find all the numbers and algorithms
	  yourself.

      As &api_name; works over HTTP, we assume that you are familiar with the operation
      of HTTP requests, as well as common formats like XML and JSON. In some cases we use XPath and JSONPath
      as well.
