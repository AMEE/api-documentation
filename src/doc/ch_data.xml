    <title>Selecting a Data Item</title>
      <para>As a neutral aggregation platform, AMEE makes available a number of different methodologies for 
        carbon calculation, which use different calculation techniques, different inputs, and different levels 
        of accuracy. The choice of which of these to use will be up to you, and should be one of the first things 
        you will decide when you come to use the platform. It will depend on your reporting requirements, legal 
        requirements, and so on.
      </para>
      <para>Every category within AMEE is individually documented in AMEEdiscover. This documentation describes 
        the functionality of each category, the source of any data or calculating methodologies, relationships 
        with other AMEE categories, and provides instructions for how to use the category to store relevant data 
        and make emissions calculations. AMEEdiscover provides powerful search and tagging capabilities, making 
        it easy to discover the categories and data items you wish to use. It also provides the ability to perform 
        instant calculations directly in your browser, so you can easily check your results, and the ability to 
        generate example code for how to use AMEEconnect to access those categories.
