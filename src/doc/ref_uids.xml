	<title>UIDs</title>
  <para>
    Every object in &api_name; has a unique identifer (UID). These are guaranteed to be unique across 
    the entire platform, though equivalent items on different servers (stage vs live, for instance) may 
    have different UIDs.
  </para>
  <para>
    UIDs should not be hardcoded in client code, as there is normally a method of
    accessing a resource that does not require a UID. However, they are often stored as references to
    objects created for calculations, such as profiles or &profile_items;.
  </para>
  <para>
    UIDs are twelve character strings containing the letters A-Z and numerals 0-9. The following
    regular expression can be used to validate UIDs, should it be required:
  </para>
  <programlisting>[A-Z0-9]{12}</programlisting>
