	<title>Drilldowns</title>
  <para>
    Drilldowns are a special resource available within every Data Category that contains Data Items.
  </para>
  <para>
    As data items are identified by UIDs in API calls such as creating Profile Items, a way is 
    required of translating human-readable choices into these UIDs. This is particularly important 
    for large categories, such as UK car models, which can contain many thousands of data items.
  </para>
  <para>
    Also, data item UIDs may be different on different AMEE platforms for the same item. Because of
    this, data item UIDs should never be hardcoded into client apps. Instead, you should use the 
    drilldown resource (which doesn't change) to obtain the UIDs, which can then be cached. 
    Drilldown details may be safely hardcoded, so that you don't necessarily have to iterate through
    the choices each time if you already know which item you want to get to.
  </para>
	<section>
		<title>Lookup a Data Item UID</title>
		<para>
      Drilldowns are performed via repeated accesses to the drilldown resource for each category. 
      Each call to the resource will give a list of choices. The API client can then select one of
      these and provide it as a parameter to the next drilldown call. When the sequence of choices
      uniquely identifies one data item, a single choice named 'uid' is returned. This is the UID 
      that should be used to refer to the chosen Data Item when creating Profile Items (see 
      <xref linkend='create_profile_item_reference'/>).

	    <title>Final Result</title>
	    <para>
	      This category has only two drill choices, so two selections are enough to fully identify a data item. The user 
	      has selected 'large' for the size choice in this example. The UID of the selected data item appears as a choice
	      named 'uid'. If user input is not required, and you know that you want to the large diesel car data item in your
	      application, you can use this form directly without having to do the previous two calls.
